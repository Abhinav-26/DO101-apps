# Branch envdev-versioning
This is the branch which I have created and pushed my codes in it for testing and practising the deployement of Nodejs Code using OpenShift Container. In this Official Training os RedHat OpenShift Container Do101 I learned about  lots of things regarding the complete Development environment to the deployement and managemnet of the deployed app.
In this training I leaned about<br>
1. Version Control System - Git
2. Setting Up complete Development environment using VS Code
3. Deployement Using OpenShift Container
4. Updation and Management of Deployed App
